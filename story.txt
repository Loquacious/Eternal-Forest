In this world, when your parents die, all of their magic powers get transferred down to their kids.
This means that only one generation will have magic. Your father is been killed by a wizard with extraordinary powers.
He sits a top a castle, made of nano-material. The castle is on the other side of the world, almost impossible to reach.
